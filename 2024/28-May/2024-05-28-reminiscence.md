(OH, I love this word!... and this heading ðŸ˜Š)

Hiya! I'm going to improve my writing skills here...  
I REALLY need to pick up a book for this too.

God I wish I wouldn't have spent so much time doing nothing.  
Had I started this earlier...  
well damn, who am I kidding... there was definitely absolutely 0% chance I'd start.  
Life was just different back then.  
It was magical & I had many heroes...  
Oh, how it all comes crashing down...

ANYWAYS... I was able to finish `1`, `2`, & `3` in approximately 1 hr.  
Opened `4` but closed it... scrolled Instagram.  
Haha `5`.  
`6` was the first thing I did & absolutely loved it!

Had I not scrolled Instagram, I would've completed Bitonic Search (maybe not Testing).
