Ok. So, firstly, I watched 2 videos of `2.` Draw-A-Box.  
It taught me about "Ghosting" (move pencil between 2 dots without touching paper.)  
I didn't had the time to do it though.

I moved on to the Office `1.` which got completed around 12.

Then I opened up the 30 min Golang video & used pen & pencil to understand it.  
It consumed all the rest of the time (close to 3 a.m.).  
I loved every second of it !

I can't see how I could have saved any time here.  
It was all lovely.

But how the hell do I continue the Algorithms man...  
Office work... I don't think it'll ever get completed in Office (too much fucking distraction & noise).  
I mean it would be lovely if I could practice communication in Office...  
hmm... maybe I should pick up a book.  
Damn there was that "Give and Take" book too.  
Time to go!!
