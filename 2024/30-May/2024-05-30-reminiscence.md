Hiya! Picka-picka (Pickachu reference ðŸ˜‹).

SOO, I was able to finish the Office stuff (`1` & `2`) by 12 a.m.  

For the "Draw-A-Box" I did a some "Plane Ghosting" exercise, and drew a Face! (I surprised myself ðŸ¤©).

Then I tried to write the Golang video notes from my copy to Github, got stuck at trying to understand something, started building a modal to test & understand it, then I felt so darn sleepy... just couldn't keep my eyes open. Gave it up at 2 a.m. and went to sleep. Didn't do much.

It's weird... past few weeks this was not a problem at all. I wouldn't fall asleep.  
When I think about it, I think I really run on hatred. The more hatred I'm feeling, the more I'm able to do.

Didn't touch "Give and Take".
