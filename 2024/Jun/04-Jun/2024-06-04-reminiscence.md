Hi again!  
And yes, I know I've not written this in 2 days.  

But, I'd like to summarize it all down below:

- `1st June`: watched Hania's Math video (pre-calculus, udemy); then went to my cousin's house inauguration & took a lot of videos â˜º.

- `2nd June`: tried to create random test cases for Bitonic Array. I failed.

- `3rd June`: WFH. Did office work and gave bitonic array test another look... failed again.
