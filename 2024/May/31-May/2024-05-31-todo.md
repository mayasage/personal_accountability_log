Woo, God(?) listened. No Office work today üòÅ.  
It's VERY important that I DON'T waste this time (she'll be unhappy ‚òπ).

OK, I REALLY need to prioritize Algorithms today.  
I NEED to complete the first week.

1. Algorithms: Bitonic Array complete algorithm - 1 hr
2. Algorithms: Test Bitonic Array algorithm - 1 hr
3. Algorithms: Extra time if needed for `1` & `2` - 1 hr
4. Algorithms: Understand the problem in Percolation - 1 hr
5. Algorithms: Find a solution to Percolation problem - 1 hr
6. Algorithms: Write the solution to Percolation problem in copy - 1 hr
7. Algorithms: Update the solution in IntelliJ (if you have time) - 1 hr

Keep moving forward. Never give up. I'm cheering you on üéà ~
